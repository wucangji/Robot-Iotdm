### homebrew
Homebrew is used to easily install many Open Source projects on OSX.

To install it, paste this at a terminal:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### `pip` and `easy install`
`pip` is one of the standard Python library installation tools.
If you can't install a library or application via `pip`, try the same with `easy_install`.

On OSX, you can typically use `pip` from your user account.

On Linux, install `pip` via `sudo apt-get install python-pip`. One difference between OSX and Linux is that on Linux, `pip` and `easy_install` require root or sudo privileges.

`easy_install` is another standard Python library installation tools.
